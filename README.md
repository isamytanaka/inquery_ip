## IP Data Lookup with ipinfo API
![](ip-address.png)
> This simple script allows you to look up information about an IP address using the ipinfo.io API.

## How it works:

1. When you run the script, you need to provide an IP address.


2. The script will make a request to the **ipinfo API** to get detailed information about the IP.


3. The returned information will be saved in a JSON file. The file name will be the IP address followed by `_info.json`. For example, for IP `123456789`, the generated file will be ``123456789_info.json``
